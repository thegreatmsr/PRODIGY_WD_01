# Interactive Responsive Landing Page with Fixed Navigation Menu

This project is a fully responsive landing page with a stylish and interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience with dynamic color changes. The navigation menu remains fixed at the top of the page, ensuring easy access across all sections. When users scroll, the menu background subtly transitions to enhance readability and maintain a professional look. 

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Navigation Menu**: The menu items change color on hover, and the entire menu bar changes background color when the page is scrolled.
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions provide a smooth effect as colors and styles change on interaction, giving a polished feel to the website.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the navigation menu and sections.
- **CSS**: For responsive styling, transitions, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the menu based on scroll position.
